#	Plentymarkets REST API LOGIN 
In this repo, I include some of my r-scripts to make Plentymarkets REST API calls with statistical software R.  R is very useful to make efficient calls especially when you have large number of orders. 
R can make the API calls very fast. Moreover, we can work on the data very efficiently to perform statistical data analysis.  R is very useful to explore and summarize the E-commerce Data.
## I add the following scripts in this repo. 
*	Plentymarkets REST API Login and get the API KEY 
*	Use API KEY and Get the Stocks
